PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS
Talks on the possibility of reintroducing
global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    The special meeting of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    However, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.
    Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    Producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of
Costa Rica said.
    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
September 30, delegates said.
    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    But consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and
Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even
adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.
    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,
they said.

grain wheat rice veg-oil soybean sugar rubber copra-cake corn palm-oil palmkernel coffee tea plywood soy-meal cotton
INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain," the report says.
    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels."
    Constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    The government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY
The International Coffee Organization
(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
consumers were diminishing by the minute.
    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
agreement, delegates said.
    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
the next six weeks or in September, they said.
    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became
apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates
said.
    Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices
soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by
nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee
producer and exporter.

tea cocoa coffee
INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN
Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
produced in 1985/86.
    In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
    The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
Indonesian cocoa beans.
    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
CTC processing plants.
    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
    Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
123,000 tonnes in 1986.
    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
    The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
competititve in the world market.

ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE
Talks at the extended special meeting of
the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the
reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of
success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.
    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian
proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,
with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new
quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop
year, they said.
    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a
quota agreement varied widely.
    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly
more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of
its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks
likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.
    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had
been tabled formally today, delegates said.
    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a
progress report, delegates said.

SENIOR DELEGATES PESSIMISTIC ON ICO TALKS
Efforts to break an impasse between
coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the
world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to
have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group
meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio
Dauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had
been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate
market shares rather than negotiate them.
    Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations
at a later date.

grain corn oat
RELIEF TO U.S. CORN/OATS GROWERS SAID LIKELY
U.S. farmers who in the past have
grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the
government that they had done so probably will be allowed to
continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program
benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program
benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to
the acreage base for that crop.
    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that
farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown
oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt
oats production or lose corn program benefits.
    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats
but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.

TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS
French operators last Friday requested
licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
French trade sources said.
    The latest requests for the maize were for export to
Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
Ecu daily rebate.
    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
dispute over grain sales to Spain.
    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
context to 25,500 tonnes.
    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an
unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK
The Canadian government is expected
to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn
exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.
government and farm group representatives said.
    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.
    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,
Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the
Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn
exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.
    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn
imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to 
corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

TWO HUNDRED FEARED DEAD IN FERRY DISASTER
About 200 people are feared
dead after a British cross-channel ferry rolled on its side off
the Belgian coast last night -- but almost 350 passengers were
plucked to safety from the ice-cold sea.
    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo told reporters: "I
fear the dead could be in hundreds, perhaps 200. Given the
state of the water, I fear there is no hope."
    Townsend Thorensen, owners of the 7,951 tonne Herald of
Free Enterprise, said the ferry was carrying 543 people and
that 345 had been rescued. All but one were British.

FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES
Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard
a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could
rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.
    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no
hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian
coast last night.
    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was
the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.
    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914
when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland
collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.
    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that
took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was
torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.
    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries
sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and
147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.

ALMOST 200 DEAD IN FERRY DISASTER
There are no more survivors from a
British cross-Channel ferry disaster off the Belgian coast and
almost 200 people seem certain to have perished, a senior
Belgian official said.
    Jacques Thas, in charge of rescue for the Herald of Free
Enterprise, said his men had searched all of the ship except
some inaccessible cabins and the control room.
    "I am afraid there are no more survivors," he said. Thas said
32 of the 543 passsengers and crew were confirmed dead and 160
were missing, bringing the total of dead or presumed dead to

EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY
As a British government investigation got
under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free
Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had
already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.
    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary
investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry
capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to
leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.
    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks
through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend
Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.
    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the
Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned
to pull them out of service at present.
    "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait
and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC
radio.
    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged
hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts
had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo"
ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.
    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime
Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on
roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck
areas divided by bulkheads.
    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German
yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety
standards.
    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would
have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its
design.
    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley
said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to
a barge.
    "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out
of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is
compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said.
    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly
stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.
    "If you do get water into that area then you can get very
severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added.

KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS
Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting."
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body"s members.
    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April." But he expected the situation would later improve.

INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE
Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."
    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"
the report says.
    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s," the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry."
    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture," the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES REMAIN FIRM
Saudi riyal interbank deposits were
steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market.
    Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions
amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting
the current decline in oil prices.
    Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab
producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC
prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency
meeting of the 13-member organisation.
    A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European
weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.
    Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct
after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.
    One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at
6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.
    The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the
dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.

QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88
The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance."
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market."
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS
OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

HOUSTON OIL &lt;HO> RESERVES STUDY COMPLETED
Houston Oil Trust said that independent
petroleum engineers completed an annual study that estimates
the trust's future net revenues from total proved reserves at
88 mln dlrs and its discounted present value of the reserves at

available for cash distributions to unitholders for the
remainder of the year.
    It said the estimates reflect a decrease of about 44 pct in
net reserve revenues and 39 pct in discounted present value
compared with the study made in 1985.

BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE AFTER COURT DECISION
Hundreds of marines were on alert
at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain
on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court
yesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners
have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.
    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the
workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our
protest until the end," a union leader said.
    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines
take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and
let the marines handle the situation by themselves.
    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to
send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister
Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national
security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has
cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.
    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their
shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two
stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.
